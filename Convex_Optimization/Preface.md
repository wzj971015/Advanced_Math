## The reason of arising research interests in this topic
1. The recognition that interior-point methods, developed to solve linear programming problems, can be used to solve convex optimization.
2. The discovery that optimization problems(beyond least-squares and linear programs) are more prevalent in practive that was previously thought. It is widely used to find bounds on the optimal value, as well as approximate solutions.

## The goal of this book and prerequisites.
The main goal of this book is to develop the skills and background needed to **recognize**, **formulate**, and **solve** convex optimization problems.

Here are the prerequisites:
- Advanced Math
- Probability
- Math Analysis(Norms, convergence, elementary topology)

Prior exposure to numerial computing or optimization is not needed, since this book has developed all the needed material from these area in the text or appendices.

This is the end of the part of **Preface**. I will study further about this topic and continue to learn about the introduction.
